# The-Battle-of-Neighborhoods
Different cities in the world are filled with numerous kinds of venues that in turn define the cultures of the cities. A city not only differs from another by means of global positioning, what it to showcase to its inhabitants or tourists has put a significant mark on differentiating it from the rest. Despite of having dissimilarities, it is somewhat possible to group together the similar kind of neighborhoods in different cities. It is possible to segment the different venues in a neighborhood according to venue category, and then to group neighborhoods together that incorporate similar kind of neighborhoods. Having grouped together similar kind of neighborhoods may serve as a variable to help make a decision when people consider moving out of a city to another.
